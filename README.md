# Bandwidth speedometer sample files

The sample files contain random text:

- sample0.txt = 1 byte
- sample1.txt = 10 bytes
- sample2.txt = 100 bytes
- sample3.txt = 1000 bytes
- sample4.txt = 10000 bytes
- sample5.txt = 100000 bytes
- sample6.txt = 1000000 bytes

These files can be useful to test the speed of:

- uploading and downloading via a network connection
- file copying
- text processing
- etc.

Comparing a small file to a large file can help show differences among:

- latency
- burst speed
- sustainted speed
- etc.
