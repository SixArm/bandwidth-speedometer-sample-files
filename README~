= SixArm.com Bandwidth Speed Meter Sample Files

The sample files random text:

- sample0.txt = 1 byte
- sample1.txt = 10 bytes
- sample2.txt = 100 bytes
- sample3.txt = 1000 bytes
- sample4.txt = 10000 bytes
- sample5.txt = 100000 bytes
- sample6.txt = 1000000 bytes

I use these files to test the speed of a network connection.

Comparing a small file to a large file can help show differences among latency, burst speed, and sustainted speed.
